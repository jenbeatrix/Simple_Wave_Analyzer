# Simple Wave Analyzer
The Simple Wave Analyzer detects the peaks of the periodic waveform (not complex waves) data in a period of time to calculate the wave period and wave height. Accelerometer and gyroscopic outputs are also obtained (from the given data) with respect to the peaks of the periodic waveform. Attenuation in the data is not taken into account. Therefore, the data provided for the waveform must be strictly periodic (complex waves are not included).
